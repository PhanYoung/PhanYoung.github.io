  abstract = {The temperature distribution spatial contour of solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) is a critical indicator for evaluating device performance, energy consumption, and maintenance safety. Conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, while accurate, suffer from excessive computational time and poor timeliness, making them unsuitable for real-time field monitoring. To address this, this paper proposes an improved Transformer neural network model driven by CFD data for real-time prediction of SOEC internal temperature field spatial contours. The model integrates a hybrid architecture of CNN and Transformer, where a multi-coupled CNN extracts operational parameter features, and a positional encoding Transformer reconstructs the spatial distribution of physical fields. Experimental results show that the model completes temperature field reconstruction within seconds, reducing computational resource consumption by over 90 % compared to traditional CFD methods. In terms of accuracy, the mean absolute error (MAE) of temperature field prediction is controlled below 2 K, and the current density field prediction accuracy exceeds 95 %. This approach breaks through the timeliness bottleneck of conventional simulations, provides an efficient and reliable technical support for intelligent operation and maintenance of SOEC digital twins and demonstrates significant engineering value for enhancing the operational stability and intelligent management of SOEC systems.},

  abstract = {Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU) is a critical processing technology in the oil refining industry, playing a vital role in energy efficiency and environmental protection. However, FCCU often encounters various abnormal operating conditions, leading to safety hazards, downtime, and reduced production efficiency. Early warning of these abnormal conditions is crucial but challenging due to high noise, strong hysteresis, and class imbalance problems. To tackle these challenges, a novel and universal attention-based framework called AEW-AOC (Attention-based Early Warning for Abnormal Operating Conditions) is specifically designed for FCCU applications. The proposed AEW-AOC framework incorporates three key components: (1) a Self-Correlation Denoiser (SCD) module is proposed to exploit spatiotemporal data correlation to effectively reduce noise; (2) a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (Conv-LSTM) module is employed to address the issue of strong hysteresis by capturing temporal variation features of process parameters; (3) an Anomaly Pattern Attention (APA) module is proposed to enhance the distinguishability of abnormal operating conditions based on clustering results from historical abnormal instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed AEW-AOC framework, particularly in practical applications. Specifically, the AEW-AOC framework obtains an impressive fβ score of 91.00% on LIC201, 90.45% on LIC202, and 90.64% on LIC801. The proposed AEW-AOC framework shows great potential in enhancing safety, reducing downtime, optimizing efficiency, promoting sustainability, and expanding its applicability beyond FCCU. Its proactive and versatile nature makes it a valuable tool for improving industrial processes and driving advancements in the field of abnormal operating condition detection and prevention.},

  abstract = {Fluidic Catalytic Cracking (FCC) is a complex petrochemical process affected by many highly non-linear and interrelated factors. Product yield analysis, flue gas desulfurization prediction, and abnormal condition warning are several key research directions in FCC. This paper will sort out the relevant research results of the existing Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms applied to the analysis and optimization of catalytic cracking processes, with a view to providing help for the follow-up research. Compared with the traditional mathematical mechanism method, the AI method can effectively solve the difficulties in FCC process modeling, such as high-dimensional, nonlinear, strong correlation, and large delay. AI methods applied in product yield analysis build models based on massive data. By fitting the functional relationship between operating variables and products, the excessive simplification of mechanism model can be avoided, resulting in high model accuracy. AI methods applied in flue gas desulfurization can be usually divided into two stages: modeling and optimization. In the modeling stage, data-driven methods are often used to build the system model or rule base; In the optimization stage, heuristic search or reinforcement learning methods can be applied to find the optimal operating parameters based on the constructed model or rule base. AI methods, including data-driven and knowledge-driven algorithms, are widely used in the abnormal condition warning. Knowledge-driven methods have advantages in interpretability and generalization, but disadvantages in construction difficulty and prediction recall. While the data-driven methods are just the opposite. Thus, some studies combine these two methods to obtain better results.},

However, due to the complexity of chemical process both in time and spatial domain, how to reflect the time and spatial characteristics of FCC units and build corresponding model is important to construct a better model for the gasoline yield prediction. In this paper, a special neural network structure was developed to deal with the input variables with different time scales considering the collection characteristics of various variables, as well as the time continuity of large-scale process manufacturing units, LSTMs with different time scales are stacked to extract temporal and spatial features to help capture the relationship between influencing factors and product yield. The characteristics of FCC process are also fully reflected in data processing and building model. It is demonstrated from the conclusions that the new model developed in this paper performs better than the traditional LSTM networks, which will be of great help to the intelligent upgrading of the FCC process.},

The prediction and understanding of the FCC performance in a real industrial environment is still challenging, as this is a highly complex process affected by many extremely non-linear and interrelated factors. In this paper, a novel hybrid predictive framework for FCC is developed by integrating a data-driven deep neural network with a physically meaningful lumped kinetic model, powered by orders of magnitude greater number of high-quality data from a modem automated FCC process. The results show that the novel hybrid model exhibits best predictions with regards to all the evaluation criteria such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error, Pearson coefficient, and standard deviation. It indicates that the hybrid data-driven deep learning with mechanistic kinetics model creates a better approach for fast prediction and optimization of complex reaction processes such as FCC.},
